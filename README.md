# Bikesharing
## Overview

This project was centered around creating visualizations from bike-sharing data in New York City to perform an analysis of the program for potential investors for a launch in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines and New York City have different challenges for a program like this, there is great insight to be had in a launch in Des Moines from the New York program. We can start by looking at the a few factors:
- Who uses the program the most?
- WHere are the bikes being used the most?
- What are the bikes being used for?

## Results
Looking at "trips_by_user_by_weekday.png", we can see that the primary use of the Citibike program is subscribers who identify as male. We can also see that they busiest days are Thursdays and Fridays.

When we compare this to "checkout_times_gender.png", we can also see that the vast majority of trips are under 20 minutes. When we look at the start and end locations, we can see that the majority of trips start and end in a relatively small portion of the city. We can infer that the majority of trips are to and from relatively short distances from where these male subscribers live, perhaps using these bikes to commute to and from work.

Looking at "trips_weekday_by_gender.png" we can confirm this by showing that most trips are centered around 8am and 5pm regardless of gender. This also means that our female users are using the services for the same reasons.

## Summary
Looking over the figures developed, we can see that bikesharing is a popular concept in metropolitan areas where traffic may be an issue. We can see that it's being used by males looking for a new and effective way to commute to and from work in areas where they might not own a vehicle and they may not have the storage space to own their own bike. This is a good place to start but there are more questions to be asked:

-What happens in the winter months where used may be down?
-Does Des Moines have the same space and traffic concerns as New York City?

Overall, I would be apprehensive to to invest in a bike sharing program that had the same target market as New York City until these questions were answered. My reccomendation would also be to explore the other avenues that Des Moines might offer for a bike sharing program, for example weekend recreation.
